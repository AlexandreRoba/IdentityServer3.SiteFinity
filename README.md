# IdentityServer3.SiteFinity
Sitefinity Identification plugin for Thinktecture IdentityServer3

This plugin should provide authentication support for SiteFInity Claim based authentication.
The idea is to avoid to use the SiteFinitySTSWebapp. 
This plugin should provide the same authentication mechanism on IdentityServer3.
